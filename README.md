# Traffic Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project involves a detailed analysis of traffic data, focusing on average speed (Avg_Speed), the 85th percentile speed (F85th), and compliance rates (F_Compliance) based on the data from OpenOttawa's ASE data, available here: https://open.ottawa.ca/datasets/automated-speed-enforcement-camera-speed-data/explore. My goal is to identify trends, correlations, and distributions within the data, which spans several months in 2023.

## Data Source

The data used in this project was collected from traffic cameras installed at specific locations. Key metrics include:

Average Speed (Avg_Speed): The average speed of vehicles.
85th Percentile Speed (F85th): The speed at or below which 85% of all vehicles are observed to travel under free-flowing conditions past a monitored point.
Compliance Rate (F_Compliance): Percentage of vehicles complying with the speed limit.
Data Processing
The raw data was transformed into a structured format suitable for analysis.

This involved:

Extracting date-wise data for each metric.
Formatting the data into a tabular form with columns representing dates and corresponding metric values.

## Analysis Conducted

The project encompasses several analytical approaches:

Basic Statistical Analysis: Calculating descriptive statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, and range for each metric.

Correlation Analysis: Exploring the relationship between average speed and compliance rates.

Visualization: Creating visual representations like a line graph, but I also want to try histograms and other cool plots

## Technologies Used

Python
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Matplotlib (for data visualization)

How to Run the Project

-   need to install python, pandas, matplotlib

## Future Work (lots to do haha)

-   want to do geospatial work
